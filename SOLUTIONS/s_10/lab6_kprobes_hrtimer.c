/*
 * Using kprobes to get statistics.
 *
 * Using kprobes, find out how often kernel timers are deleted before
 * they are run.
 *
 * Examination of the kernel source discloses that timers are started
 * with either add_timer() or mod_timer()
 *
 * You can see how often timers are deleted by monitoring del_timer()
 * and del_timer_sync(); however, on single processor systems,
 * del_timer_sync() is not defined.
 *
 * Timers are frequent so you will probably not want to print out
 * every time they are queued up or deleted, but say every 100 times
 * plus final statistics.
 *
 * Is it possible that timer deletion can be more frequent than timer
 * queuing?
 *
 * Extra Credit: Do the same thing for high precision timers,
 * examining hrtimer_start(), hrtimer_forward() and hrtimer_cancel().
